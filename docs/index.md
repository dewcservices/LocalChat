# What is LocalChat?

LocalChat is an AI chatbot that can analyse, summarise, and answer questions given text-based documents as input.

The app differentiates itself from other LLM services by running entirely locally within the user's web-browser. 
The app does not make any requests over the local-network or the internet - ensuring that your data exists only within
your local device.

Additionally, the app does not require any software dependencies to run, making it ideal for use cases where 
confidentiality is of utmost importance.

This project was started as a university student project in collaboration with DEWC Services.

See the [LocalChat github repo](https://github.com/andrewtran3643/LocalChat) for the code & app.

# What is the purpose of these GitHub Pages?

These pages serve as a running blog to document the dev teams findings/progress throughout the project.

The blogs themselves vary between short miscellaneous findings, progress updates, design choices, and more.
